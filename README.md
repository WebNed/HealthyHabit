# HealthyHabit
HealthyHabit is a basic time tracking website that uses timers to let you know how much time you have spent on an application. Just type in a string of letters in one of the textboxes or upload a JSON file and you will instantly take control of the timer, with the ability to start, pause or stop it. You can also download that data to a JSON file.
