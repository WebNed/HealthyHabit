# HealthyHabit
HealthyHabit is a basic time tracking website that uses timers to let you know how much time you have spent on an application. Just type in a string of letters in one of the textboxes or upload a JSON file then take control of the timer by starting it, stopping it or pausing it. You can alsow write the current data to a JSON file to use for yourself.
